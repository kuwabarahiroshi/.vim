# .vim
Well organized vim settings.

## Installation
To use this vim settings, all you have to do is

```
cd
git clone --recursive git://github.com/kuwabarahiroshi/.vim.git
ln -s .vim/rc.d/.vimrc
vim # -> installs plugin bundles automatically.
```

That's it!

## Caveats
If you already have your own `~/.vim` directory, Please back it up beforehand.

## Plugins
Plugins which I'm using are listed at:

[rc.d/mod_bundles](rc.d/.mod_bundles)

To add plugins, please refer to [NeoBundle.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) guidance.
